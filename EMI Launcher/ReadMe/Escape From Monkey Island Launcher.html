	<p class="style7"><strong><em>New in this version:</em></strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li class="style7">Resolution patch reworked:<br>
		It's now much faster. On most systems it will only take 1 or 2 seconds to apply - compared to 30 seconds in previous versions.</li><br>
		<li class="style7">Vista compatibility:<br>
		The launcher now automatically prompts to run as administrator when its started (this is required for the resolution patch, since it usually needs to write to the program files dir).<br>
		The program icon now includes all sizes up to 256x256.</li><br>
		<li class="style7">Added features from the original Lucasarts launcher:<br>
		Switch between Direct3D/OpenGL and 16 bit/32 bit colour. The original launcher now wont run on some systems so it was necessary to include these features.</li><br>
		<li class="style7">Added support for the 6 different language versions of EMI:<br>
		The launcher will now download and install the appropriate patch when prompted. Previously only the English patch was supported.</li><br>
		<li class="style7">Fixed a small memory leak.</li><br>		
		<li class="style7">Cosmetic changes:<br>
		Interface redesigned, text and icons made clearer, removed some of the launcher images.</li><br>
		<li class="style7">New launcher icon:<br>
		Now uses the excellent EMI icon created by <a href="http://thanius.com/pixmaps/scummvm/">Thanius</a>. </li><br>
		<li class="style7">64 bit versions of windows:<br>
		Now officially supported. The launcher has been tested on XP64 and Vista64. </li><br>
		<li class="style7">Old versions of windows no longer officially supported:<br>
		Versions before  XP (95/98/ME/2000) should be fine but the launcher hasnt been tested or designed with them in mind.</li><br>
	</ul>
	
	<p class="style7"><strong><em>What is Escape From Monkey Island Launcher ?:</em></strong><br>
	  A replacement launcher program for Escape From Monkey Island (Monkey Island 4).<br> 
	  It has features not present in the original launcher:</p>
	<ul>
		<li class="style7">Can run EMI in windowed mode.</li><br>
	    <li class="style7">Can make EMI run in a higher resolution (subject to some limitations, see the bugs/limitation section below).</li><br>
	    <li class="style7">Supports all recent versions of Windows (XP, XP64, XPMCE, Vista, Vista64). Windows 98, ME and 2000 are not officially supported but should work correctly.</li><br>
	    <li class="style7">Can automatically download and install the V1.1 update patch for all language versions of EMI. </li><br>
	    <li class="style7">Loads one of 10 random images as the main launcher image - for added eye candy. </li><br>
	</ul>

	<p class="style7">The program does not need to be installed and can be run from anywhere since it reads the registry values in order to find the location of EMI. Consequentally, Escape From Monkey Island must be installed for the launcher to work correctly.</p>


	<br>
	<p class="style7">
		<em><strong>How to use it:</strong></em>
		<br>
		Usage should be fairly self-explanatory:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li class="style7">Click either <i><u>Play fullscreen</i></u> or <i><u>Play windowed</i></u> to start the game.</li><br>
		<li class="style7">The <i><u>Lucasarts readme</i></u> button displays Lucasarts' EMI readme, while the <i><u>Launcher readme</i></u> button displays this readme.</li><br>
		<li class="style7">Click <i><u>Change Resolution</i></u> to bring up the Change Resolution window. Choose a resolution from the dropdown box and then click 'Change' to change the resolution that EMI runs in.<br><br>
						   The resolution patch has been tested on patched and unpatched English versions of EMI. If you use a version of EMI for another language it *should* still work but this is untested.</li><br>
	</ul>
	
	<p class="style7">Click 'Options' to bring up the options menu.</p>
	<ul>
		<li class="style7"><i><u>Close launcher on play:</i></u><br>
		If enabled, then the launcher closes when one of the play buttons is clicked.</li><br>
		<li class="style7"><i><u>Get update patch:</i></u><br>
		This automatically downloads and installs the V1.1 game update. </li><br>
		<li class="style7"><i><u>Direct3D/OpenGL:</i></u><br>
		Lets you choose between the two rendering modes.</li><br>
		<li class="style7"><i><u>32 bit/16 bit colour:</i></u><br>
		Allows you to switch between the different colour modes.</li><br>
	</ul>

	<br>
	<p class="style7">
		<em><strong>Bugs/Limitations:</strong></em>
		<br>
		There are known issues with the resolution patch. Cutscenes display in a 640x480 window and do not fill the screen and there may be screen artifacts such as tearing.
		<br><br>
		Saved games are not always compatible between different resolutions. They will usually work, but may have visual glitches (eg invisible Guybrush).
